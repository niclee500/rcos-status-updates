## Last Week’s Accomplishments
This week I implemented some pseudo code to test the Longest Road feature. I am not quite done with it/know if it will work, but I will test it over the break

## This Week’s Plan
Over the break, I want to keep working on the Longest Road of Catan to make sure that it works for all corner cases of road designs
## Anything Blocking?
Nothing at the moment.
## Notes

## Last Week’s Accomplishments
This week I implemented some pseudo code to test the Longest Road feature. I am not quite done with it/know if it will work, but I will test it over the break

## This Week’s Plan
Over the break, I want to keep working on the Longest Road of Catan to make sure that it works for all corner cases of road designs. Another goal I have in mind
is to think about the AI of the project since I am relatively new to what AI really is. I plan to do more research and document my research over
spring break about what I learn.

## Anything Blocking?
Nothing at the moment.

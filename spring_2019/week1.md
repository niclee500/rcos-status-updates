## Last Week's Accomplishments
  Last week I enhanced the design of the Catan board so it was more readable. The previous method I did took much more memory space
  than was needed. With this newly formatted board, it will be easier to debug when there are issues in the future
## This Week's Plan
  This week I want to add ports to the board. These ports will involve trading resources.
## Anything Blocking?
  Nothing blocking at the moment. The only challenge I will have to face is reformatting the board so the ports are legible.

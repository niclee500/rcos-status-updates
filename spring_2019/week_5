## Last Week’s Accomplishments
Last week I worked on improving certain functions for the Catan game. I did this through the process of Unit testing; I tested
corner cases to functions such as the longest road function, bot playing, etc.

## This Week’s Plan
This week I focused on working on more error testing and debugging regarding the catan bots that Ishita and Justin are making. 

## Anything Blocking?
Nothing at the moment.

## Last Week’s Accomplishments
Last week I took most of my time trying to get more information from collegues about generating AI for boardgames. Since Justin
and Ishita are taking different approaches and there is not much more for me to test (since they are still in developing phases), I want to
attempt to create my own AI

## This Week’s Plan
This week I will create sample bots that will play the game itself, so the game can test itself on its own without a player actually
playing the game. This will speed up the process of debugging.

## Anything Blocking?
Nothing at the moment.

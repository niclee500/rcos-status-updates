## Last Week’s Accomplishments
Last week we finished the implementation of the Catan game. Now, we are moving on to the implementation of the Catan AI. I did a lot of research regarding Catan strategies and statistics over the course of a long period of games. 
I learned about very different playstyles and how it can be implemented into a Catan AI.

## This Week’s Plan
This week I plan to follow along with the potential AI Ishita is proposing for the project. Also, I will be debugging and error testing
Justin's "completed" Catan game. We already found a bug where the Robber implementation does not allow a player to steal from a player.

## Anything Blocking?
Nothing at the moment.

## Last Week’s Accomplishments
Last week I worked on debugging the prototype AI used to make the game. This mainly involved functions regarding chance and statistics.
I also worked with Justin and Ishita in figuring out their AI model in regards to statistics and implementation in our Catan game. 
I also tried to research more into our peer's (people we talked to about Catan AI) work regarding to board game AI.

## This Week’s Plan
This week I focused on working on the AI with Justin and Ishita and attempt to create a predesignated win condition for the Catan game
to play against their AI's. In addition to this, I'm trying to make code that runs the game for me without me having to debug it after every move.
This way debugging will be easier.

## Anything Blocking?
Nothing at the moment.

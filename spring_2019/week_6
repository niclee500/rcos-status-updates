## Last Week’s Accomplishments
Last week I worked on debugging the prototype AI used to make the game. This mainly involved functions regarding chance and statistics.

## This Week’s Plan
This week I focused on working on the AI with Justin and Ishita and attempt to create a predesignated win condition for the Catan game
to play against their AI's

## Anything Blocking?
Nothing at the moment.

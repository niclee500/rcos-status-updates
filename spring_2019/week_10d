## Last Week’s Accomplishments
This last week I worked on future plans to bring this Catan game into the next semester. I am thinking about how I could apply this work to
future RCOS projects.

## This Week’s Plan
This week I plan to test Ishita's and Justin's implementation of Catan AI's since they are so close to being done. They have worked a lot
on Expected Cost theorum and I want to see if it functions in relation to Catan AI. Also, I have been working on cleaning up the repository 
since a lot of stuff is all over the place and we need to clean it up for other people to understand. 

## Anything Blocking?
Nothing at the moment.

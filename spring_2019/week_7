## Last Week’s Accomplishments
Last week I did not get to do much due to several tests during the week, but I have been thinking about more ways to improve the UI for the
Catan game. Also I fixed UI problems regarding player vs player interactions. Specifically, Player A should not be able to see Player B's 
resources. This is a big issue because players can cheat on some moves.

## This Week’s Plan
This week I will be focusing more on developing my own AI and researching strategies for the game. This will mean that the "AI" will be
more simplified and have a set path for completion (winning). In addition to this, I will continue to work on player vs player interaction
UI to improve the game.

## Anything Blocking?
Nothing at the moment.

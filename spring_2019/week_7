## Last Week’s Accomplishments
Last week I did not get to do much due to several tests during the week, but I have been thinking about more ways to improve the UI for the
Catan game. 

## This Week’s Plan
This week I will be focusing more on developing my own AI and researching strategies for the game. This will mean that the "AI" will be
more simplified and have a set path for completion (winning).

## Anything Blocking?
Nothing at the moment.

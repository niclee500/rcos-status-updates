## Last Week’s Accomplishments
Last week I was refining the code by thinking and writing more testcases regarding Catan. In addition to this, I am thinking of new ways to
improve the UI so it is more user friendly. In other words, I want to create a way where one player cannot see another player's
resource information so we can prevent cheating.

## This Week’s Plan
This week, I want to work on a solution to prevent player cheating (looking at another player's resources), which is a good
point Wes Turner brought up during our presentation.

## Anything Blocking?
Nothing at the moment.

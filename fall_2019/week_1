## Last Week’s Accomplishments

Last week I worked a lot on learning Django and getting set up with the software. I asked for a lot of resources on chat.rcos.io and received
help from various members leading me to videos and websites on how to code in Django. In addition to this, I also took the effort to learn more
about REACT, which is an object-oriented language that works on the back-end of websites.

## This Week’s Plan

Over this week, I plan to work more with REACT and Django and attempt to create sample test websites. In addition to this, I need to figure out
out how I would want to contribute to this group and how the website would function. There is a lot of planning yet to be done in this phase-
there is a lot more to learn.

## Anything Blocking?

The only thing blocking me and this project is the knowledge I have of Django and REACT. As stated in the project proposal, this will be more
of a learning process than development.

## Notes
- Do more sample code in Django
- Download appropriate software for REACT.

For week 1, I was refreshing my skills with LTSpice. It has been a while since I have used LTSpice software. In order for me to understand more about Operational Amplifiers, I think that I have to do more research online and talk to Gavin about what its functionalities and purposes are for them. One challenge I have is trying to find the LM358 chip on LTSpice which is necessary to test frequency detection. For next week, I will research more into ways I can simulate the frequency detection circuit on LTSpice.

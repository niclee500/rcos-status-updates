For week 1, I was refreshing my skills with LTSpice. It has been a while since I have used LTSpice software. 
One challenge I have is trying to find the LM358 chip on LTSpice which is necessary to test frequency detection.
For next week, I will research more into ways I can simulate the frequency detection circuit on LTSpice.
